In this warm up, you and your coding partner will work together to solve two JavaScript coding challenges. One person will start as the Driver ðŸš˜ and the other as the Navigator ðŸ§­. Once you finish the first challenge, you will switch roles.

    Decide who will start as Driver and who will be the Navigator.
    The person that will start as the Driver should start a Zoom.us video call (if you aren't already on a call), invite the other person, and share their screen.
    Then the current Driver will click here to get two challenges assigned* (each one of you will solve one of the challenges).
